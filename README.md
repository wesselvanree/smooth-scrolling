smooth scrolling for webpages with javascript

Make sure to define at how many pixels your navigation flips on line 8 and the height of your different navigations
```javascript
const breakPoint = 798;
const desktopNavHeight = 69;
const mobileNavHeight = 49;
```

On line 55 you can put a function to close your navigation
```javascript
// put close navigation function here
// for example: closeNav(mobileNavBtn);
```
