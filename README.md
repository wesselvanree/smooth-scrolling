## Description

Smooth scrolling for links that refer to an element on the same page using `window.requestAnimationFrame`. You can add extra space between the top of the window and the target element. You can add one of two different values on from the top of the window depending on the given breakpoint.

## How To Use

To start using this script, first download the [smoothScroll.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wesselvanree/smooth-scrolling/master/dist/smoothScroll.js) file or copy the code in your own file js file.

### Configuration

For more easing functions, take a look at  [easings.net](https://easings.net/). When you have chosen which one you want, I recommend looking at the javascript function [here](https://gist.github.com/gre/1650294).
